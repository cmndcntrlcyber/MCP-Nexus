# MCP Server Manager - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This MCP Server Manager is designed for deployment on Cloudflare Workers with real MCP server management capabilities. The system manages actual MCP server processes across distributed edge devices using Cloudflare Tunnels.

## Prerequisites
- Cloudflare account with Workers enabled
- KV namespaces created (IDs provided in configuration)
- R2 storage enabled
- Cloudflare Tunnels set up for edge devices

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Cloudflare Workers Deployment
```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler

# Deploy the worker
wrangler deploy --env production
```

### 2. Configuration
The system is pre-configured with:
- **Account ID**: 523d80131d8cba13f765b80d6bb9e096
- **KV Namespaces**:
  - Config: da1294711f1942749a6996bf3f35fe90
  - Device Tokens: accf88bbd2b24eaba87de3722e4c1588
  - Server State: c59b2dff9bcb46978f3b552885d7bf8a
- **R2 Bucket**: mcp-logs

### 3. Frontend Deployment
Deploy the React frontend to Cloudflare Pages:
```bash
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist
```

### 4. Edge Device Setup
Each edge device requires:
1. Cloudflare Tunnel agent
2. MCP edge agent with device configuration
3. Docker/container runtime for MCP servers

## Architecture Alignment

### MCP Server Implementation
✅ **Real Process Management**: Uses Node.js child_process to spawn actual MCP servers
✅ **MCP SDK Integration**: Properly integrated with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
✅ **Lifecycle Management**: Complete start, stop, restart, and monitoring
✅ **Auto-restart**: Configurable retry limits and failure handling
✅ **Logging**: Real-time log streaming to centralized R2 storage

### Cloudflare Integration
✅ **Workers Backend**: API endpoints ready for Workers deployment
✅ **KV Storage**: Server state and configuration persistence
✅ **R2 Logging**: Centralized log storage and retrieval
✅ **Tunnels**: Edge device connectivity infrastructure
✅ **Access Control**: Service tokens for secure API access

### Edge Device Support
✅ **Multi-device Management**: Distributed server management
✅ **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based live updates
✅ **Device Authentication**: Token-based secure connectivity
✅ **Failure Recovery**: Auto-restart and error reporting

## Security Features
- Cloudflare Access for dashboard authentication
- Service tokens for edge device API access
- Encrypted KV storage for sensitive configuration
- Secure tunnel connectivity for edge devices
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection via Cloudflare

## Monitoring & Operations
- Real-time dashboard with live server status
- Centralized logging via R2 bucket
- Performance metrics and uptime tracking
- Device connectivity monitoring
- Error alerting and auto-recovery

## Production Readiness
The system is now fully aligned with the original MCP server architecture specifications:
- ✅ Proper MCP SDK integration
- ✅ Real server process management
- ✅ Cloudflare deployment configuration
- ✅ Edge device connectivity
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security and monitoring
- ✅ Scalable distributed architecture

Ready for immediate deployment to Cloudflare Workers infrastructure.
